Hi,

Thanks for your interest in organising a Python workshop in your college. The following questions are to be asked to any college/university willing to host workshop sessions:

1. Can you arrange a full-day workshop ?
2. What is the expected number of attendees ?
3. Do you have PC's/laptops for the students to work on, at the venue ?
4. Do the attendees have previous knowledge about Python ?
5. What are your expectations from the workshop ?

Getting the answers to these questions will help us to ease the process of organising a workshop at the particular venue. 

Cheers,

[Your name here]
