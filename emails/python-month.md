###WHAT IS PYTHON

Python is a dynamic object-oriented programming language that can be used for a diverse area of software development. It offers strong support for integration with other languages and tools, comes with extensive standard libraries, and can be learnt in a few days.

Many Python programmers report substantial productivity gains and feel the language encourages the development of higher quality, more maintainable code.

Some of the biggest names in the industry like Mozilla, Google,
YouTube,Dropbox, SurveyMonkey, Bitly and numerous others also use Python for providing the services a lot of users are familiar with.

Because Python is very easy to learn and at the same time very powerful, it is used as the first programming language in introductory courses of Computer Science in many universities and high schools.

In India, Kerala state and CBSE have already adopted Python in their school syllabus.
