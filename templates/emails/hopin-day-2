## Day 2

Hey {{ user.first_name }},

We hope you had an amazing and eventful first-day at PyCon India 2021, and you got to learn a lot of stuff.

We will be kicking off the second day of the conference on September 19, 12:00 IST (UTC+5:30). You can join us in the same Hopin event as day 1 using <> and our [Zulip channel](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/join/ykzqdmjnllr5xcxbroz2tmhb/).

We would encourage you to join the Networking, Neurodiversity, and Birds of Feather sessions. Along with poster session Q&A's and awesome panel discussions we got in store for you. Reach out to the [Help Desk](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/258750-2020.2Fhelpdesk) on Zulip or Hopin if you have any problems during the conference, or if you want to ask something. Please make sure you follow the conference [Code of Conduct](https://in.pycon.org/2020/coc/) to make the conference a great experience for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you again tomorrow.

Regards,
