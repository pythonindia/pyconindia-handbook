## Day 2

Hey {{ user.first_name }},

We hope you had an amazing and fun first-day at PyCon India 2020, and you got to learn a lot of stuff.

We will be kicking off the second day of the conference on October 3rd, 12:00 IST (UTC+5:30). You can join us in the same Hopin event as day 1 using <> and our Zulip channel using [this link](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/join/ykzqdmjnllr5xcxbroz2tmhb/).

We would also encourage you to join the Networking sessions, diversity, and Birds of Feather sessions, and sponsor booths to interact with other attendees and our sponsors when you have idle time during the conference.

Reach out to the Help Desk on [Zulip](https://pyconindia.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/258750-2020.2Fhelpdesk) or Hopin if you have any problems during the conference, or if you want to ask something. Please make sure you follow the conference [Code of Conduct](https://in.pycon.org/2020/coc/) to make the conference a great experience for everyone.

Looking forward to seeing you again tomorrow.

Regards,
PyCon India Team
