## Template for the invitation for CFP

Hello {{POTENIAL_SPEAKER_FIRST_NAME}},

We hope you are in good health and doing well. This email is regarding PyCon India 2020 inviting you to submit a proposal for our open call for proposals. PyCon India is the premier conference for the Python programing language in India and has been running for well over 12 years, scaling in both size and attendees. Last year, we had over 300+ proposals! What's better, we are completely non-profit and volunteer-run through and through, helping promote Python through many communities around India. 

With the current situation, we, the conference organizers, are taking the unique opportunity to put more effort into making our conference bigger, more inclusive, and much more accessible to all our attendees. Working on this new direction, we would be glad to see your proposal at our conference. We believe your experience, expertise, and insights with Python and/or with Python community will be a critical part of making this conference a huge success. 

We really hope to see your proposal(s). The deadline to submit is 14th August 2020 and the schedule would be released on 1st September. Please do reach out to us if you have any questions. If you like to learn more about writing proposals for talks and workshops, you can read one of the blogs below:
