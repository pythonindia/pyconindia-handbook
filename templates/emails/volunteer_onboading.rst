[SUBJECT] PyCon India { Year } | Welcome aboard volunteer

Hello { Name },

Thank you for showing interest in becoming a volunteer for PyCon India 2021.

- Before we move forward please check out details about the conference Code of Conduct[0] and different Work Groups you can volunteer in from WG handbook[1].
- Once you're sure about the WG, feel free to head towards PyCon India Zulip[2] and look for streams which start with 'wg/'. For example, if you are interested in Content WG, head to 'wg/content'.
- Make sure you've subscribed to the Zulip WG streams you're interested in and only have conversation regarding the work that's specific to that group, keeping conference Code Of Conduct in mind.
- WG leads will share tasks in Zulip streams and you can raise your hand by commenting on the tasks you wish to volunteer in.

Additionally, if you have any other query feel free to reply to this email.

I'm open to scheduling a volunteer onboarding call, please reply to this email if you're interested in joining the call.
