Hey,

This email is in regards to PyCon India 2020 mentorship group. In 2020, we are
going virtual which means we have less work to do around venue preparation and
logistics. We (conference organizers) take this as an opportunity to direct our
efforts in making this conference a great experience for attendees in other
ways.

One way we can do that is to help bring out the best in our speakers. We see
value in pre-event rehearsals of the talks and have put together a great team
of volunteers to help speakers in tweaking their presentation. Since this is a
peer review process and driven by volunteers, we are looking for more
volunteers to join us and help in making this a success. We believe you have
great experience in Python and/or Python community and we would love to have be
a part of this group.

A mentor would need to give anywhere from 3 to 9 hour of time spread out in the
next 3 weeks depending on number of revisions they think is needed per talk and
the number of talks they are interested in mentoring,

If you think you can help us with this, please let me know and I will get back
to you with more details.

Thank You,
looking forward to hearing from you.
