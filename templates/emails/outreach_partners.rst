Hello [ Team / Org name/ person name],

Greetings of the day! I hope [you/you all] are doing well.

I am {your_name} from the PyCon India[1] team and really excited to inform you that this is the 12th year of PyCon India and it's happening online in the month of October, 2020.

PyCon India, India's premier conference on using and developing the Python programming language, will be online this year. PyCon India is the annual conference of the Python community in India, which brings together developers, experts, academics, scientists, and enthusiasts from all over India and abroad. It is one of the largest Python conferences in Asia.

We would love to have your support at PyCon India 2020 and invite your community to join hands and help us reach more interested pythonistas. PyCon India is looking for outreach partners that can help spread the word about the conference in their communities and help bring more fresh faces to the event. We are the largest gathering of Python users and admirers in India who come together once a year to celebrate the language and share our experience and expertise with the community. It would be great to have your community play a more active role in making PyCon India 2020 a truly community driven event.

We expect our outreach partners to help us in the following ways: 
- Send emails to their mailing lists and post content on their social media channels on our behalf to make their community members aware of the conference. 
- Spread the word about our call for proposals for talks, workshops & Dev sprint and help us find speakers, mentors, and reviewers from their community for the conference.

For supporting the conference, our outreach partners can expect following in return from PyCon India:
- Display their Logos and Names on the conference website. 
- The conference will also promote the partners on our social media channels as a supporter of the conference.

Please note the following details:
- The primary channel of communication will be Zulip[2], post confirmation.
- There will not be any discounts on ticket prices or any other financial benefits of any kind, since PyCon India 2020 is a volunteer driven event.
- Outreach partners for PyCon India 2020 will not be carried forward to further years.

Please let us know by responding to this email if you are interested in supporting PyCon India by becoming an outreach partner to us. We are looking forward to your support!
