## Template for Inviting folks to keynote

Hello {{POTENIAL_KEYNOTE_SPEAKER_FIRST_NAME}},

We hope you are in good health and doing well. This email is an invitation for you to be a keynote speaker for this year's PyCon India. PyCon India is the premier conference for the Python programing language in India and has been running for well over 12 years, scaling in both size and folks attending. Last year, we had over 300+ proposals! What's better, we are completely non-profit and volunteer-run through and through. Helping promote Python through many communities around India. 

This year with the current situation [1] We, the conference organizers, are taking this as a unique opportunity to be able to put more efforts into making this year's conference bigger, more inclusive, and much more accessible to our lovely attendees from all over the world in ways more than one. And, we would your help with the same. We would be glad to see you at our conference. We believe your experience and insights with Python and/or with Python community will be a critical part of making this conference a huge success being a keynote speaker!

Please do reach out to us if you have any questions. 

Thank your for taking the time to read through and hope to see you as a speaker at PyCon India 2020
